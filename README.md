## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16.0.0 or higher)
- **npm** (v7.0.0 or higher) or **yarn**
- **Git**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lost-and-found-frontend.git
   cd lost-and-found-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   
   Edit `.env.local` with your configuration:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
   REACT_APP_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   REACT_APP_UPLOAD_MAX_SIZE=5242880
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`


### Components
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Accessible color contrasts
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: New users create accounts with email validation
2. **Login**: Users authenticate with email/password
3. **JWT Storage**: Tokens stored securely in localStorage
4. **Route Protection**: Private routes check authentication status
5. **Token Refresh**: Automatic token renewal before expiration
6. **Logout**: Secure token cleanup and redirect


## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Write tests for new features
- Follow the existing code style
- Update documentation as needed

## 📊 Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting**: Dynamic imports for route-based splitting
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Compressed images with proper formats
- **Bundle Analysis**: Regular bundle size monitoring
- **Caching**: Service worker for offline functionality

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- **JWT Security**: Proper token storage and validation
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitized user inputs
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **HTTPS**: Secure data transmission
